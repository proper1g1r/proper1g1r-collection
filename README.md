## Missing systems and games

### Games not found

They're not present in [No-Intro ROM Sets (2024)](https://archive.org/details/ni-romsets) or [Myrient](https://myrient.erista.me/files/No-Intro) and weren't found anywhere else.

- Atari - 8-bit Family is missing [Centipede (Europe)](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=203&n=0009).

### Systems not found

Same as the missing games, no ROMs matching the DAT file were found.

- LeapFrog - Explorer

### Systems with an empty DAT file from DAT-o-MATIC

The usual DAT generation options used (no bios, only full titles, etc) resulted in an empty DAT file.

- Atari - Jaguar (COF)
- Atari - Lynx (BLL)
- Atari - Lynx (LNX)
- VTech - Mobigo

### Systems with no DAT file generated by Retool

### Systems too large

They may eventually be added to the collection.

### Systems not part of the collection

They have no actual games.

### Systems flagged as malware by archive.org
